    <title>Katherine Reed - Front-End Developer</title>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Please generate a single page website using accessible, semantic HTML, that contains the following: a headline with my name (Katherine Reed) and a subheading that reads, "Accessible User-Interfaces for the Mobile Era". Above the headline, please include a placeholder for a headshot image. Below the subheading , please include my short bio:

"Katherine Reed is an accomplished front-end developer who helps small, independant businesses to have a presence on the web. Some say she perfectly blends design and technology like it's the best cup of coffee you'e have ever had. Kat's strategies come from their many year's of experience: over 20 years developing websites."

After the biography, can you create 3 placeholder sections: one for 5 trust logos, one for a call to action that should be some text and a button that says "Schedule a call", and a form for an email opt-in. -->
