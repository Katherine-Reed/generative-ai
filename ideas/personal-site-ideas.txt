I'm working on a new personal website. I'm a front-end developer and website designer and would like to have a resume site that has my experience, information about me, and how to get in touch, the services I offer, and some social proof. I would also like to have a blog where I talk about how to launch, grow, and monetize your website. The goal is to get more people to hire me. Is there anything you think I am missing from a website like this?
