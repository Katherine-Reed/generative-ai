what are some other independent bookstore websites I can look at for inspiration?

1. Bookshop.org: Bookshop.org is a socially conscious alternative to Amazon. It has raised more than £1 million for independent bookshops since its launch in November. The online retailer donates 10% of all sales to indies every six months. You can find a wide range of books and support independent bookstores across the UK1.

2. Golden Hare Books (Edinburgh): Named the Independent Bookshop of the Year at the British Book Awards in 2019, Golden Hare Books offers a well-curated selection of books. They’ve been selling online throughout the year, so you can explore their website for inspiration2.

3. Hive (Online Bookshop): While not an independent bookshop itself, Hive is connected to hundreds of independent booksellers across the UK. When you make a purchase, a percentage of the money goes toward an indie shop of your choice. You can also choose to pick up your order from a local independent shop2.

4. The Bookish Type (Leeds): Leeds’ newest indie bookshop, The Bookish Type, offers an immense range of books by LGBTQ+ authors. They started as a popup and have now established an online presence2.

5. Sevenoaks Bookshop (Sevenoaks Town): This lovely bookshop has been around since 1948, focusing on stocking emerging literature and classics. Their website is a great example of an independent bookstore2.

6. Category Is Books (Glasgow): A relatively new independent LGBTQ+ bookshop in Glasgow, Category Is Books sells a wide selection of new and second-hand queer books, magazines, graphic novels, and zines. The owners are passionate about their offerings and can even order specific books for you2.

Remember to explore their layouts, features, and how they showcase books and authors. Each of these bookshops has its unique charm, and you might find inspiration for your own self-published book store website!
