<!--Great! Now I would like the HTML template for an about page using version 2 of the template you just created. The about page should have a hero section with an intro paragraph, and a photo of the store. Below that, a section for the rest of the about text, which should include the following:

Our Story
Mission and Values
Meet Our Team

You can use placeholder images anywhere you need to. The HTML should be accessible, semantic and SEO-friendly. The HTML markup should also use appropriate schemas when necessary.-->
